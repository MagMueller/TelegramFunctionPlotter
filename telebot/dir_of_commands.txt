When telegram changes you inpiut frame you inbut with Backstaps (`)

When only having a one dimensional function you can just send your function with like this:
'your function'

and then ask for simple plots, intregrals, derivates,

just by tiping in 

plot
integrate
derivate

when you wan't to set the derivate or integral to your current function use the /set command

To delelete the function stored use the /delete command
